# Pollinations Prompt Optimization - Deep Study

## How Pollinations/Flux Processes Prompts

### Key Findings:
1. **Flux follows prompts very closely** (97.3% fidelity)
2. **Order matters** - Early details get more weight
3. **Specificity is crucial** - Exact numbers, colors, positions
4. **Text generation** - Can include text/names if explicitly requested
5. **Composition understanding** - Understands photography terms well
6. **Detail accumulation** - More details = better results

### Pollinations-Specific Behaviors:
- Responds well to **structured, comma-separated** descriptions
- Understands **professional photography terminology**
- Can generate **text/names** when explicitly requested
- **Brand names** work better when mentioned multiple times
- **Size descriptions** help (small/medium/large)
- **Color specificity** improves accuracy

## Optimal Prompt Structure for Pollinations

### Format:
```
[Subject with ALL details] + 
[Composition/Camera] + 
[Lighting] + 
[Branding/Text] + 
[Quality Keywords] + 
[Style/Aesthetic]
```

### Key Principles:
1. **Lead with subject details** (flowers, quantities, colors)
2. **Be extremely specific** (exact numbers, exact colors)
3. **Mention brand multiple times** (reinforces importance)
4. **Include text explicitly** ("with text 'Bexy Flowers'")
5. **Use photography terms** (Flux understands these)
6. **Describe arrangement** (how flowers are positioned)

## Branding Strategy

### For Text in Images:
- **Explicit mention**: "with elegant text 'Bexy Flowers'"
- **Position**: "branded with 'Bexy Flowers' name"
- **Style**: "golden text 'Bexy Flowers'"
- **Multiple mentions**: Include in subject AND style sections

### Best Practices:
- Mention brand 2-3 times in prompt
- Specify text color/style
- Indicate position (on box, on ribbon, etc.)
- Use descriptive adjectives (elegant, premium, luxury)
